# PopTrade

PopTrade is a modern, responsive web application designed to provide investors with a unified and comprehensive view of their stock and cryptocurrency portfolios. In a world where financial assets are spread across multiple platforms, PopTrade acts as a centralized command center, aggregating crucial market data and personal holdings into a single, intuitive interface.

The application leverages real-time data from industry-leading sources like the **FinnHub API** for stock market information and the **CoinDesk API** for cryptocurrency prices, ensuring users have access to timely and accurate data to make informed decisions. Built with a powerful tech stack including **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, the dashboard is not only functional but also fast, responsive, and visually appealing on any device.

The primary goal of PopTrade is to empower the user by replacing the complexity of tracking diverse investments with a streamlined, at-a-glance overview of their complete financial picture.
